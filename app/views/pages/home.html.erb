          <p>Stephen was very disappointed not to find some historical timelines which could give
          simultaneously the context in ancient Greece and Holland. This is how is born Almanac.lol. His project was initially
          developed at the end of a bootcamp with the batch 891 - Le Wagon with 3 other
          students.Now a huge worldwide success story. Almanac helps every days million of
          users to get an immediate overview of historical facts.

          has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
          to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
          and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
